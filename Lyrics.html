                <legend><em>Optimistic - By: The Rampager</em></legend>
                <p>I say I’m optimistic</p>
                <p>Though others say I’m blind</p>
                <p>And not realistic</p>
                <p>Cause I've been cheated all the time</p>
                <p>So why the fuck would I risk it</p>
                <p>Well I always see silver on a rusted dime</p>
                <p>But do you take me as a dip-shit</p>
                <p>I aint gonna sit back</p>
                <p>And stick with it</p>
                <p>I thought you’d be different</p>
                <p>Not some bitch on a dick trip</p>
                <p>Have someone else butter your biscuit</p>
                <p>Because you think that I give a fuck</p>
                <p>That you’re hitting a fag with a fit bit</p>
                <p>Who owns a truck with a 4 inch lift kit</p>
                <p>Cause all you proved is that you’re a smash and dash slut</p>
                <p>Who will to fuck any guy</p>
                <p>Willing to bust a nut</p>
                <p>Well maybe I am blind</p>
                <p>Or just too stupid to realize</p>
                <p>And maybe I’m to kind</p>
                <p>To notice the hook</p>
                <p>Beneath the bait line</p>
                <p>Though you saw this love as a contract</p>
                <p>But guess what bitch I just unsigned</p>
                <p>I never saw fucking your ass</p>
                <p>Labeled on my time line</p>
                <p>But I changed I don’t play games</p>
                <p>I don’t cheat just to point blame</p>
                <p>I don’t fuck just to take names</p>
                <p>But fuck it you weren’t doing the same</p>
                <p>So I’m done with you I’m through with you</p>
                <p>So do whatever the fuck you wanna do</p>
                <p>Just don’t look back on whats become of you</p>
                <p>A raging cunt with sons of two</p>
                <p>Im saying good by wishing good luck to you</p>

                <legend><em>Lost In Your Own Haze - By: The Rampager</em></legend>
                <p>People are stuck in a haze,</p>
                <p>Lost in their own faze,</p>
                <p>Where crime never pays,</p>
                <p>And drugs aren’t served on trays,</p>
                <p>Well…</p>
                <p>I would like to introduce you to reality,</p>
                <p>Where women are being crushed by mentality,</p>
                <p>Guys are stuck watching profanity,</p>
                <p>And people taking drugs like there's no insanity,</p>
                <p>But that’s not the way it had to be,</p>
                <p>We could have sat by the canopy.</p>
                <p>Made better of society,</p>
                <p>And chosen people by their variety,</p>
                <p>But no, we chose by popularity,</p>
                <p>Now we kids are inheriting,</p>
                <p>A world with parents acting carelessly,</p>
                <p>And starting false charity’s,</p>
                <p>Getting their kids taken away, you see,</p>
                <p>So why are we the ones suffering?</p>
                <p>When you think that money is the key,</p>
                <p>To success and living happily,</p>
                <p>So you start applying these hidden fees.</p>
                <p>To everything,</p>
                <p>Unknowing of these new enemies,</p>
                <p>So they attack and you start begging for sympathy,</p>
                <p>Asking yourself why are they pissed at me,</p>
                <p>Well go look back at history,</p>
                <p>Cause it is not a fucking mystery,</p>
                <p>On what we need to change to stop this misery,</p>
                <p>And no it’s not the price range of delivery,</p>
                <p>Get your lazy ass up and start living realistically,</p>
                <p>Realize that the key to success is not consistency,</p>
                <p>Go Apply yourself to a university,</p>
                <p>Stop looking for similarity and look for diversity,</p>
                <p>And maybe then, you will find a connection,</p>
                <p>But to be able to live in a world without rejection,</p>
                <p>You need to begin a new age of exception,</p>
                <p>Start a new path in a different direction,</p>
                <p>To image this picture you need a new perception,</p>

                <p>On how the fuck I went by without you</p>
                <p>Causing a sharp pain in my chest and brain</p>
                <p>The urge for your presence is driving me insane</p>

                <p>Blowing through the cops like there a barricade</p>
